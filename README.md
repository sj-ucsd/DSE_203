# DSE_203
203 project
## Package details
**sstopgraph** package takes a semistructured data in json format as input and generates pgraph in json format as output. 
The package is available from test Pypi at https://test.pypi.org/project/sstopgraph-pkg/1.1/ 
*** build instructions ***
To build and deploy the package locally, recommend following steps:
1. Create a virtual environment. Example steps to create and activate virutal environment are as follows:
   - Change to your working directory
   - python3 -m venv <name of your virtual environment>. For example `python -m venv dse203` will create a virtual environment named dse203
   - Activate virtual environment. On Linux/Mac, run `source myenv/bin/activate` on Windows, `myenv/bin/activate`
   - **Note:** virtual environment can also be created using `conda` and in such case the following steps \
     still apply and allow one to import **sstopgraph** in jupyter notebook. This step has not been tested. 
2. download the **sstopgraph_pkg**. Perform following steps:
   - To install the pacakge in the virtual environment above, after actvation, run `pip install -e .` This step will build the **sstopgraph** package locally and available to be imported in any python program
   - to check correct installation, run python on terminal and type `from sstopgraph import sstopgraph` - this should work correctly
3. To check usage, see the example file **test_sstopgraph_transform.py**
4. Sample code once installed:
   ```
   from sstopgraph import sstopgraph
   sstopgraph.semistruct_to_pgraph(<input file name including path>, \
         <mapping configuration file name including path>,[output file name including path],[debug=True])
   ```
   If output file is not specified, an output file with name pgraph.json is automatically generated. debug parameter is optional.
